### Software Engineering Manager in Telerik ALM Division (1 year)
I led a small team who owned [Telerik Test Studio for APIs](https://www.telerik.com/teststudio-apis), software for recording and executing REST API tests. I gathered requirements, designed and specified the software from the ground up. Test Studio for APIs is built using .NET Core for the test runner and .NET Framework, WPF, PRISM and Telerik RadControls for the GUI.

### Software Engineering Manager in Telerik ALM Division (1 year)
I led a small team who owned several products. I gathered requirements, groomed the backlog, developed features and improved old code that was difficult to maintain. I also trained junior developers and helped improve the documentation and the quality of the software.
- [Telerik Team Pulse](https://docs.telerik.com/teampulse/) - a mature agile project management system for SCRUM (now defunct), written in C#/Silverlight using ASP.NET MVC3, Linq2SQL, Entity Framework, Web API, Unity, JQuery, etc.

### Team Lead in Telerik Foundation Services (2 years)
Together with a couple of other senior developers in Telerik I started the R&D, grew a team and completed some of the critical parts in the upcoming (at that time) [Telerik Platform](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/telerik-platform-101): Billing Services, Continuous Deployment and Security/Authentication Services, all written in C#, using ServiceStack, Unity, Couchbase and RabbitMQ. I was leading the one of two sub-teams that was responsible for the Billing Services and the Continuous Deployment. In addition to our main products, we designed and provided interfaces and reusable components for other teams in Telerik: Distributed Logging, Messaging, Authentication modules for .NET and Node.js. 

### Team Lead in Telerik RadControls for WPF/Silverlight (5 years)

In this team I trained junior developers and support engineers, and often gathered requirements from customers.

### Team Lead in Telerik RadControls for ASP.NET (2 years)
I led one of the three teams who owned the hugely successful at the time [RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx). I designed and implemented features, trained junior developers and support engineers, wrote documentation and handled difficult support. My team was responsible for RadEditor, RadUpload, RadDock, RadSpellCheck and other controls. 

### Software Developer (2 years)
I started my career in Telerik in a small team who had the task to develop a new corporate web site. I wrote the support ticketing system (that became the only support channel in the company for the next 10 years), basic CMS system, CRM system, and many other small components, all written in C# and RadControls for ASP.NET.

## Sodec (not existing anymore) 2000 - 2002
