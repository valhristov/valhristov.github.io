## [Elca](http://www.elca.ch) 2019 - 2020
### Senior Software Engineer / Consultant
From my first day I was deployed at Inexto and worked on the project above.

## [SonarSource](http://www.sonarsource.com) 2016 - 2019
### Software Engineer in the Language Team (2.5 years)
Part of the Language team, I designed and developed dozens of source code analyzers, as well as many features in several open source projects: Sonar C#, Sonar VB.NET, SonarLint for Visual Studio and SonarScanner for MSBuild. The projects are written in .NET and Java, and use the .NET compiler (Roslyn) and Visual Studio APIs.

## [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com) 2003 - 2016 (acquired by [Progress](http://www.progress.com) in 2014)
### Software Engineering Manager in Telerik ALM Division (1 year)
I led a small team who owned Telerik Test Studio for APIs, software for recording and executing REST API tests. I gathered requirements, designed and specified the software from the ground up. Test Studio for APIs is built using .NET Core for the test runner and .NET Framework, WPF, PRISM and Telerik RadControls for the GUI.

### Software Engineering Manager in Telerik ALM Division (1 year)
I led a small team who owned several products:
- Telerik Team Pulse - a mature agile project management system for SCRUM (now defunct), written in C#/Silverlight using ASP.NET MVC3, Linq2SQL, Entity Framework, Web API, Unity, JQuery, etc. 
- App Feedback, a service in Telerik Platform (a SaaS product, now defunct) that allowed the developers to manage client feedback, sent through a Cordova plugin. It was written in JavaScript and HTML5, using Node.js with Express, Angular.js, Cordova. 
- Task Tracker, a service in the Telerik Platform that provided simplified project management functionality and integration API with third party project management software. It was written in JavaScript and HTML5, using Node.js with Express, Angular.js. 

I gathered requirements, groomed the backlog, developed features and improved old code that was difficult to maintain. I also trained junior developers and helped improve the documentation and the quality of the products.

### Team Lead in Telerik Foundation Services (2 years)
Together with a couple of other senior developers in Telerik I started the R&D, grew a team and completed some of the critical parts in the upcoming (at that time) Telerik Platform: Billing Services, Continuous Deployment and Security/Authentication Services, all written in C#, using ServiceStack, Unity, Couchbase and RabbitMQ. I was leading the one of two sub-teams that was responsible for the Billing Services and the Continuous Deployment. In addition to our main products, we designed and provided interfaces and reusable components for other teams in Telerik: Distributed Logging, Messaging, Authentication modules for .NET and Node.js. 

### Team Lead in Telerik RadControls for WPF/Silverlight (5 years)
I led a team who owned several products from the highly successful RadControls for WPF and RadControls for Silverlight: Scheduler, GanttView, Dock, ComboBox and other controls and frameworks, such as drag-drop, base controls, themes, etc. I designed and developed large parts of Scheduler, GanntView and ComboBox, and helped with the development of many other components. In this team I trained junior developers and support engineers, and gathered requirements from customers. All of the code in RadControls for WPF/Silverlight was shared between WPF and Silverlight, and my team implemented many WPF features that were missing from Silverlight â€“ extended Dependency Properties, Routed Events framework, etc. 

### Team Lead in Telerik RadControls for ASP.NET (2 years)
Development, support and documentation of RadControls for ASP.NET (C#/ASP.NET). I was leading the one of the three ASP.NET control teams that was responsible for RadEditor, RadUpload, RadDock, RadSpellCheck and other controls. 

### Software Developer (2 years)
Development of the new corporate web site, support ticketing system and home-grown CRM, all written in C# using ASP.NET. I was part of a team consisting of four developers and we wrote from scratch: a CMS system to support the corporate web site, forums and support ticketing system to drive the customer feedback and basic CRM system to keep track of clients and orders. 

## Sodec (not existing anymore) 2000 - 2002
### Software Developer (2 years)
Development of software for building e-commerce web sites from XML templates (VB6/XSLT/HTML). I inherited a product that had to be mostly rewritten in order to be extendable and supportable. My main responsibility was to implement new features and fix not working parts of the software.
